# Start an OceanBase cluster

After you deploy OceanBase Deployer (OBD), you can run the `obd demo` command to deploy and start OceanBase Database on a single local server. Make sure the following prerequisites are met:

- Ports `2881` and `2882` are not occupied.

- At least 6 GB of memory is available on the server.

- At least two CPU cores are available on the server.

- At least 54 GB of disk space is available on the server.

> **Note**
>
> If the foregoing prerequisites are not met, see [Use OBD to start an OceanBase cluster](../3.user-guide/2.start-the-oceanbase-cluster-by-using-obd.md).

```shell
# Deploy and start OceanBase Database.
obd demo
# Run the following command to connect to OceanBase Database by using the OBClient:
obclient -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -P2881
```
