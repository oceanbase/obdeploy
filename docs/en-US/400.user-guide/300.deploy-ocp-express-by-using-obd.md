# Deploy OCP Express by using commands

This topic describes how to use commands to deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Express in environments with and without an OceanBase cluster.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>Each OBServer node in the cluster must have a corresponding OceanBase Agent (OBAgent). Otherwise, OCP Express cannot run properly.</p>
</main>

## Prerequisites

* The version of OceanBase Database is V4.0.0.0 or later.

* The version of OBAgent is V1.3.0 or later.

* The version of OBD is V2.0.0 or later. If the OBD version in your machine is below V2.0.0, you can refer to the **How to Upgrade OBD** section in [Frequently Asked Questions](../500.faq/100.faq.md) to upgrade OBD.

* The machine where OCP Express is deployed needs to first install and configure the Java environment. At present, only Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8 is supported. For more information, see the **How do I configure the Java environment before I deploy OCP Express?** section in [FAQ](../500.faq/100.faq.md).

* More than 512 MB of memory is reserved for OCP Express. We recommend that you reserve more than 762 MB of memory for OCP Express to ensure long-term stable running.

## Resource specifications of OCP Express

### Configuration requirements

The OCP Express service generates high computing and storage overheads during running. Therefore, you must perform resource planning based on the specifications of managed objects. The following table lists the resource consumption of the OCP Express server based on the assumption that each cluster contains 10 tenants. You can calculate the resource consumption and properly configure resources based on the actual situation.

| Number of servers to be managed | CPU (core) | Memory (GB) | Disk (GB) |
|-------------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| ≤ 10 | 1 | 2 | 20 |
| ≤ 20 | 2 | 4 | 20 |
| ≤ 50 | 4 | 8 | 20 |

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>Configure resources for the OCP Express server based on the preceding overhead data and other resource consumption information of the system. To ensure system stability, we recommend that you configure at least 4 CPU cores and 8 GB of memory for the OCP Express server. When a single host contains 10 tenants or less, the 4C8GB configuration is still recommended.</p>
</main>

### MetaDB resources

Meta Database (MetaDB) stores the metadata and monitoring data of OCP Express. We recommend that you create an independent tenant in the OceanBase cluster for MetaDB.

The resources required vary with the number of OBServer nodes managed in OCP Express. The following table lists the CPU, memory, and disk resources for each replica in a tenant for MetaDB based on the assumption that each cluster contains 10 tenants. You can calculate the resource consumption and properly configure resources based on the actual situation.

| Number of servers to be managed | CPU (core) | Memory (GB) | Disk (GB) |
|-------------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| ≤ 10 | 1 | 4 | 50 |
| ≤ 20 | 2 | 8 | 100 |
| ≤ 50 | 4 | 16 | 200 |

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The resource consumption provided here is a ballpark figure. The actual resource consumption of MetaDB varies with the business volume.</p>
</main>

## Scenario 1: Deploy an OceanBase cluster and OCP Express together

If you want to deploy an OceanBase cluster and OCP Express at the same time, you must configure the tenant information required by OCP Express in the oceanbase-ce component. You can directly declare in the configuration file that the configurations of the ocp-express component depend on other components such as oceanbase-ce, obproxy-ce, and obagent. In this case, you only need to configure `home_path` and `memory_size`, and other parameters are obtained from the dependent components.
Configuration of the oceanbase-ce component:

```yaml
oceanbase-ce:
  servers:
    - name: server1
      ip: 172.xx.xxx.4
  global:
    home_path: xxxx
    ...
    ocp_meta_tenant:
      tenant_name: ocp_meta
      max_cpu: 2
      memory_size: 6442450944
    ocp_meta_db: ocp_meta
    ocp_meta_username: ocp_user
    ocp_meta_password: 
    ...
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|--------------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| ocp_meta_tenant->tenant_name | No | The name of the meta tenant created for OCP Express.  |
| ocp_meta_tenant->max_cpu | No | The maximum number of CPU cores allocated to the meta tenant.  |
| ocp_meta_tenant->memory_size | No | The memory allocated to the meta tenant.  |
| ocp_meta_db | No | The database that stores data for OCP Express.  |
| ocp_meta_username | No | The name of a user in the meta tenant.  |
| ocp_meta_password | No | The password of the user. If you do not specify the password, OBD automatically generates a random password. After the deployment is completed, you can run the `obd cluster edit-config` command to view the password in the configuration file. |

The parameters beginning with `ocp_meta_tenant` are passed when the tenant is created. The foregoing table shows only some important parameters. For specific parameters, see the parameters supported in the tenant creation command. For more information, see the description of the `obd cluster tenant create` command in [Cluster commands](../300.obd-command/100.cluster-command-groups.md).

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>If the preceding parameters are not specified, OBD will create a meta tenant for OCP Express based on the default resource specification. However, the number of tenants is unpredictable. Therefore, we recommend that you modify the resource specification of the meta tenant as needed based on the following formula:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>data_disk = 3.5 + Node quantity × 0.5 (unit: GB)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>log_disk = 4.5 + Node quantity × 0.5 + Tenant quantity × 0.5 (unit: GB)</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
</main>

During the bootstrap of the oceanbase-ce component, if OBD detects that the preceding parameters are specified or the ocp-express component exists in the current cluster, OBD automatically creates the corresponding meta tenant and user.

Configuration of the ocp-express component:

```yaml
ocp-express:
  depends:
    - oceanbase-ce
    - obproxy-ce
    - obagent
  servers:
    - name: server2
      ip: 172.xx.xxx.5
  global:
    # The working directory for ocp-express. ocp-express is started under this directory. This is a required field.
    home_path: /home/oceanbase/ocp-server
    # log_dir: /home/oceanbase/ocp-server/log # The log directory of ocp express server. The default value is {home_path}/log.
    memory_size: 1G # The memory size of ocp-express server.  The recommend value is 512MB * (expect node num + expect tenant num) * 60MB.
    logging_file_total_size_cap: 10GB # The total log file size of ocp-express server
```

The following table describes the parameters.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|--------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| home_path | Yes | The working directory of OCP Express. OCP Express boots from this directory.  |
| memory_size | Yes | The memory capacity of the OCP Express server. Recommended formula for calculating the memory size: 512 MB + (Expected node quantity × Expected tenant quantity) × 60 MB.</br>The sys tenant and the meta tenant for OCP Express must be included.  |
| logging_file_total_size_cap | Yes | The total log file size of ocp-express server, defaults to 1GB. <blockquote>**Note**: </br>The unit for this parameter needs to be GB or MB. If G or M units are used, an error will be reported and OCP Express cannot be successfully deployed. </blockquote> |

After you modify the configuration file, run the following commands to deploy and start the cluster.

```shell
# Deploy the cluster.
obd cluster deploy <deploy name> -c config.yaml
# Start the cluster.
obd cluster start <deploy name>
```

After the cluster is started, log in to OCP Express based on the login address and account password of the output `ocp express`. The first login will prompt for password modification. After modification, log in according to the modified account password to use OCP Express.

## Scenario 2: Add OCP Express to an OceanBase cluster

If an OceanBase cluster is already deployed and you want to add OCP Express to the cluster, perform the following steps.

1. (Optional) If the version of OBAgent in the cluster is earlier than V1.3.0, run the following command to upgrade OBAgent.

   ```shell
   # View the hash value of OBAgent.
   obd mirror list oceanbase.community.stable | grep -e " obagent "
   # Upgrade OBAgent.
   obd cluster upgrade test -c obagent -V 1.3.0 --usable=<obagent_hash> 
   ```

   You must replace `obagent_hash` in the command with the hash value of OBAgent of the corresponding version.

2. Create a meta tenant, user, and database for OCP Express and grant the required permissions to the user.

   1. Create a meta tenant.

      ```shell
      obd cluster tenant create <deploy name> -n <tenant_name> --max-cpu=2 --memory-size=4G --log-disk-size=3G --max-iops=10000 --iops-weight=2 --unit-num=1 --charset=utf8
      ```

      For detailed introduction of the `obd cluster tenant create` command, see [Cluster Command Group](../300.obd-command/100.cluster-command-groups.md).

   2. Create a user and grant permissions.

      ```shell
      create user <ocp_user> identified by '<ocp_password>';
      grant all on *.* to <ocp_user>;
      ```
  
   3. Create a database.

      ```shell
      create database <database_name>;
      ```

3. Modify the configuration file.

   Sample configuration file:

   ```yaml
   ## Only need to configure when remote login is required
   # user:
   #   username: your username
   #   password: your password if need
   #   key_file: your ssh-key file path if need
   #   port: your ssh port, default 22
   #   timeout: ssh connection timeout (second), default 30
   ocp-server:
     servers:
       - name: server1
         ip: 172.xx.xxx.5
